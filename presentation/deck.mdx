# Proposal
### Styling 🌈

---

### What I propose? 🌹

---

### CSS-in-JS inside of SASS 💁‍♂️

---

### Why?
### Let's go over it 🚀

---

### Right now, 
#### we are using SASS for styling

---

### But, SASS as it is, 
#### wasn't specifically built for building component-based user-interfaces...

---

### So what are the problems?
## Let's discuss

---

### 1. SASS abstracts the CSS model to the Document model
## rather than Component model

---

### What this means is...

---

### We get a large main.css bundle file
#### that basically has every style we have ever written
#### irrespective of whether that particular component is rendered or not...

---

## With CSS-in-JS

---

### We will be getting only those styles which are currently in use

---

### 2. Specificity

---

### The problem of naming classes 🤷

---

🤣

---

#### However we decide to name them, we can't run away from the problem of having selector collisions...

### On top of this,
#### We shouldn't spend so much time in NAMING only 🙄

---

### In addition to it, 
#### CSS has properties which are inherited automatically from the parent element, if not explicitly defined

---

## With CSS-in-JS

---

## We don't need to worry about all this...

---

### It generates unique class names for all our styles 

### So, that we don't have to worry about duplication, overlap or misspellings...

---

### Some other benefits of using CSS-in-JS over SASS/CSS

---

### No build step...
#### As a result — no extra dependencies to build the styles...

---

### Allows automatic vendor prefixing

---

### Dead code elimination 😰

---

### Unit tests for CSS ✅

---

### Just one language, standardized by W3C.

---

### Any questions❓❓❓

---

## According to some... 🤖

---

## The evolution looks like this 🤣🙅‍♂️
